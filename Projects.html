                <h3>Speech and Facial Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning</h3>
                <img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Speech and Facial Emotion Recognition">
                <p>Built a deep learning system to recognize emotions from speech and facial expressions, integrating memory mechanisms for enhanced accuracy. Used Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to process audio (MFCC features) and video data, training CNN and RNN models for multimodal analysis. Implemented memory-augmented neural networks to retain contextual patterns, improving emotion detection by 12% over baseline models. Managed datasets with MySQL for storing user profiles and recognition logs, ensuring scalability and GDPR compliance.</p>

                <h3>Software Defect Prediction</h3>
                <img src="images/project2.jpg" alt="Software Defect Prediction">
                <p>Developed a machine learning model to predict software defects, improving code quality and reducing testing time. Trained and evaluated multiple algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest) using Python, scikit-learn, and pandas to identify the best-performing model. Achieved highest accuracy with Random Forest, building a robust defect prediction model that improved detection by 15% compared to baseline methods. Preprocessed large datasets with feature engineering to enhance model performance, using Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation. Collaborated with development teams to integrate the model into CI/CD pipelines.</p>

                <h3>Churn Prediction in Over-the-Top</h3>
                <img src="images/project3.jpg" alt="Churn Prediction Model">
                <p>Built a machine learning model to predict subscriber churn for an OTT platform, helping retain users by spotting those likely to leave. Used Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to clean and analyze user data like watch history, subscription details, and engagement trends. Created custom features and applied algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, achieving an 85% prediction accuracy for Crafted clear visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight churn drivers.</p>

                <h3>Portfolio Website with Interactive Animations</h3>
                <img src="images/project4.jpg" alt="Portfolio Website">
                <p>Designed a responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects and skills. Added interactive animations, like hover effects, scroll-triggered transitions, and dynamic navigation, to enhance user engagement. Utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox for a clean, two-column project layout, ensuring mobile responsiveness with media queries. Optimized performance by compressing images and minimizing JavaScript, achieving a 90%+ Lighthouse score. Deployed the site on Netlify, integrating it with Git for version control.</p>
